#Building smallmvc with Maven2 should be as simple as:

#Installing Maven2
apt-get install maven2

# You need to install the Yasdic jar in your local repository first.
# I will try to have it installed in the maven central repository, but until then, you need a local install.
# To do so, just checkout the Yasdic sources, and run the "mvn" command.

#Building the project, packaging the jar and installing them on the maven local repository
mvn

#Updating your eclipse workspace to add the M2_REPO variable
mvn eclipse:configure-workspace -Declipse.workspace=PATH_TO_WORKSPACE

#Creating eclipse project files and downloading dependency sources
mvn eclipse:eclipse

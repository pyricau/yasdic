#Building CountaDroid with Maven2 should be as simple as:

#Installing Maven2
apt-get install maven2

#Installing the Android SDK as explained here : http://developer.android.com/sdk/1.5_r2/installing.html

#Telling maven the path of your Android SDK. 
#To do so, you need to update your maven settings.xml file (it should usually be created in $HOME/.m2):

<settings>
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>android</id>
      <properties>
        <android.sdk-location>[PATH_TO_SDK]/android-sdk-linux_x86-1.5_r2</android.sdk-location>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
  <activeProfiles>
    <activeProfile>android</activeProfile>
  </activeProfiles>
</settings>

#Building the project, packaging the apk in debug mode, and installing it on the maven local repository
mvn

#Building the project, packaging the apk in release mode (ie signing it), and installing it on the maven local repository
mvn -P android-release

#Updating your eclipse workspace to add the M2_REPO variable
mvn eclipse:configure-workspace -Declipse.workspace=PATH_TO_WORKSPACE

#Creating eclipse project files and downloading dependency sources
mvn eclipse:eclipse

#You can now open CountaDroid with Eclipse.
#Whenever you build using the command line (for instance for a release), Eclipse may show errors in the project.
#To get rid of them, just refresh (F5) the project.

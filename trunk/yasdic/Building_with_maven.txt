#Building Yasdic with Maven2 should be as simple as:

#Installing Maven2
apt-get install maven2

#Building the project, running the tests, packaging the jar and installing them on the maven local repository
mvn

#Updating your eclipse workspace to add the M2_REPO variable
mvn eclipse:configure-workspace -Declipse.workspace=PATH_TO_WORKSPACE

#Creating eclipse project files and downloading dependency sources
mvn eclipse:eclipse
